## Pending Financial Aid

Pending financial aid has not been deducted from the Total Due. 

Pending financial aid can generally be subtracted from the amount due to calculate the correct amount to pay. 

However, Title IV Federal Financial Aid may not automatically apply to all charges on the bill. If the pending financial aid does not post to he student account by the due date, interest and billing fees will be assessed on the unpaid balance. Financial aid will show as pending if the student is enrolled full-time and all financial aid requirements and holds have been met. Students can view the status of their financial aid in Duckweb.
