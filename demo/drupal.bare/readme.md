# Drupal Bare page content 


## Overview

Context: Drupal7

Sometimes it may be necessary to populate a Drupal node with HTML markup that in a way that was not originally anticipated by the theme originator. This scenario is described in more detail in the following blog post [fn01].

For example:

* you may need to port one or more pages from another site into drupal
* you may need to quickly construct a custom landing page on one or more sections of the site
* you may have content that depends on a front-end MVC library not yet supported by your theme or modules
