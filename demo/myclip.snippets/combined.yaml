            Hi Megan,
        
        This issue occurred after the customer had left our system at the university and was giving his 
        payment info to our third party payment processor (www.nelnet.com), and so I cannot be sure 
        of the reason for the credit card being declined.
        
        The most common reasons for being told a credit card is invalid include:
        Expired card
        Cancelled card
        Credit Limit exceeded
        Unaccepted card type (not Visa, MasterCard, or Discover)
        Card Issuer (their credit card company) declines approval for an unspecified reason such as:
        Temporary suspension due to a missed payment, 
        a limit/cap on available credit that is exceeded by the purchase, 
        a factual error reported when verifying the provided account holder information (such as billing address, zip code, or phone number).
