## Overview

Trevor is a new employee at CognitiveDynamix, a company that makes custom-designed coffee cups.

One day, Trevor's bos Ulrich sees Trevor pushing some buttons and turning some dials on a robot-automaton. Trevor intends to use this robot to do some of Trevor's work so he can get more done during his work hours.

Ulrich cautions Trevor with a rule:

```
The employees at CognitiveDynamics are strongly discouraged from tinkering with 
robot-automatons at work, because this tinkering time takes away from productivity
time doing actual work.

As a rule, CognitiveDynamics employees do not tinker on robot-automatons unless those
automatons will be used to generate at least four major projects in a year.
```
