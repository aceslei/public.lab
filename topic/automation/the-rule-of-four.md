## Overview

Trevor is a new employee at CognitiveDynamix, a company that makes custom-designed coffee cups.

One day, Trevor's boss, Joseph Stephen Obfusco, sees Trevor pushing some buttons and turning some dials on a robot-automaton.

Trevor intends to use this robot to do some of Trevor's work so he can get more done during his work day.

Joseph Stephen Obfusco cautions Trevor with a rule:

```
THE JSO RULE OF FOUR PROJECTS:

The employees at CognitiveDynamics are strongly discouraged from tinkering with 
robot-automatons at work, because this tinkering time takes away from productivity
time doing actual work.

As a rule, CognitiveDynamics employees do not tinker on robot-automatons unless those
automatons will be used to output at least four major projects in a year.
```

At the time, Trevor does not quite understand this. He thinks this sounds quite arbitrary. 
"For example, what is so magic about the number four?" He thinks to himself.

Nevertheless, being new and a generally amicable guy who wants to avoid a reputation as a
troublemaker, Trevor does not dispute or question the rule, and simply accepts it on face value.

Later that day, Joseph Stephen Obfusco asks Trevor to repeat the rule back to him, as well as
the underlying rationale for the rule, as a test to see if Trevor actually "gets it".

## Problem

Trevor can parrot back the rule quite easily, but he cannot give a rationale for the rule.

Moreover, Trevor has a nagging sense that the rule cannot withstand critical scrutiny:
  
* In the old days, robot-automatons required a lot of tinkering and disparate skills, but these days, they are off-the-shelf commodities that require nothing more than battery replacement and routine cleaning.
* In the old days, robot-automatons had to be programmed in order to do tasks, but these days, they also work by "record" and "playback" feature.
* The record and playback feature means Trevor only has to do a task once (with the robot in 'watch and record' mode) and then the robot can repeat the task indefinitely in 'playback mode' as many times as needed, so long as the battery does not run out.
* Although the robot can *also* do some specialized tasks through programming, Trevor only uses the programming mode when off duty and learning more about the internals of the robot.
* When Trevor uses the robot at work, he simply uses the "record" and "playback" feature.
