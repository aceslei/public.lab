Diablo 3 has been out for almost a month now. A good number of launch day players have one or several level 60 characters, and they’re working on and learning about Hell and Inferno. They’re experiencing the entirety of what this incredibly-anticipated title has to offer. 

And many of them are coming up disappointed.

If they’re like me, they’re enjoying the feel of the combat, love the art style and animation, appreciate the diversity and challenge of the four acts, and realize that it’s a top-tier game in every sense of the word. But what they’re realizing is that the overall feel of character progression, the all-important “item grind” has been deeply diminished by the Auction House. 

In theory, using the Auction House is an “option”, but it turns out that it’s optional in much the same way that a keyboard is an “option” for using a personal computer. For whatever the Auction House’s interface short-comings, it’s proven to be more than enough to let millions of Diablo 3 players saturate the market with items of all shapes and sizes, and more importantly to filter those items well enough to generate intense competition. It’s so easy to find items, in fact, that it’s become by far the path of least resistance for overcoming any challenge in the game, because there’s not a whole lot between levels 1 and 59 that can’t be blown apart by an infusion of cheap Auction House items. Hitting 60 and delving into Inferno, that trend explodes into a requirement, where progress is essentially stalled until gear of the appropriate nature is filtered and purchased at the best price available.

In that way, the nature of character development in Diablo has shifted drastically. The previous titles in the Diablo series were all about getting that loot to drive you a hair closer towards mastery of the game’s challenges. In Diablo 3, it’s only about the items only in a roundabout way; now it’s about the gold. Farming the gold and spending it in the most efficient way possible. Budgeting your gold has become drastically more important than strategy or skill, and knowing the Auction House is the key to success.

The Background 

Let’s take a step back and consider how the Diablo itemization scheme came to be, by taking a look at how it worked in Diablo 2. Much like D3, items in D2 were freely trade-able to anybody and everybody. Similarly, they were scarce. Couple scarcity with demand, and the natural result is that people have a strong incentive to trade items they don’t desire for ones they do, for their given class, playstyle, etc. At a basic level, D2 supported this trade interaction in the form of built-in trading channels. This level of support was quickly demonstrated to be insufficient for the complexity of the trading environment, and it moved on to trading forums across the Internet where players were able to express their offerings and their desires with greater clarity. It gave rise to an informal-but-variable set of exchange rates, which was flexible and dynamic but frankly a giant pain in the !@# to operate under. 

For better or worse, the next level of sophistication involved schemes for exchanging real money either directly for items or indirectly for imaginary currency that could be traded for desired items. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these unsupported transactions were fraught with headaches and often undertaken by shady characters. And yet, the attraction of a powerful Diablo avatar was such that a great many people were willing to undertake the risk. Compared to modern MMO’s it seems like a fairly quaint idea, but it was what it was. Ultimately, only a small fraction of players participated at this level, or even to the level of trading at all, but it was nonetheless considered a fairly large part of the game.

Enter Diablo 3

It was ostensibly with good intentions that Blizzard announced their plans to implement two options for players to trade their goods in Diablo 3, the Gold Auction House, for use with their in-game gold currency, and the Real Money Auction House, for use with… duh, real money! Avoid unscrupulous rip-off artists with a Blizzard approved transaction channel! Can’t go wrong, right??

Well, you can. But in a much different way.

The Gold Auction House has been so “successful” that it’s come to dominate just about everything else in the game. The proof is in the pudding: Look through just about any Internet conversation about how to succeed in Diablo 3, and you’ll see as more discussion about what items to purchase off the Auction House and how to make the money to afford those purchases than you will anything else about the game. Buying low and selling high has become the language of Diablo 3. 

And it gets particularly ugly because the farmers caught on to this before the game was even released.

World of Warcraft had gold farmers. Lots of them. And that was a game where, frankly, gold didn’t even get you a whole lot. Now they’ve got a game where gold is a real currency, where every single item in the game is a trade item. Gold will continue to be a powerful currency after the RMAH, and they’ll be selling you items on the RMAH while they’re selling you gold to buy items on the GAH. They will be farming and flooding the market basically tirelessly, and there’s nothing Blizzard can do to prevent this, because they’re just *playing the game*. This *is* the game. Frankly, the glut of players reaching level 60 and getting into Inferno are going to be doing exactly the same thing. And it’s going to get messy.

The Consequences 

Here are some ways that it’ll probably shake out. 

For one, as the high-end gamers start to crunch into Act 3 and 4, there’s going to be a trickle of high-level items into the AH that eventually becomes a flood. High-end items that really actually desirable for tackling the hardest content in the game will surge upward in prices, because gold is entering the system at a substantially greater rate than it’s leaving. Even now, barely four weeks into the game, high-end item costs far exceed what the average player can actually grind out. Meanwhile, low- and medium-end items are depressing in price *rapidly*, in direct proportion to well players can search for them. As players start really grinding against Act 3 and Act 4, producing a glut of level 63 items, you can expect most of those items to quickly become dirt cheap, and those at the top end to go out of sight. Once the top-end becomes the playground of the serious player, you’re going to see, for example, 1500 dps items basically become the norm, because on the whole, they’ll be dropping en masse, and the players picking them up won’t have anything to do with them but slap them up on the AH until it’s not even worth their time to do so. 

Because these items essentially never leave the system, it’s just going to be a war at the top with a huge glut at the bottom. A player will hit level 60 and get a ton of gear at firesale prices that propels them immediately to Act 3 and 4, sailing right past Acts 1 and 2, where again they’ll slam into a brick wall when it takes forever to grab an upgrade to complete the sliver of content they have left. And then they’ll get bored and stop playing. The only people left will be the addicts. 

The Bad and the Ugly

The state of affairs in the Diablo 3 end game right now already stinks. It’s already turned into an unfulfilling grind where knowing how to set your Auction House filters is more important than successfully playing the game. But here’s the sad truth: it’s only going to get worse. Prices are going to get even more out of wack with the expected progression of game content, further trivializing any attempt Blizzard made at creating a well-balanced progression curve. Most players are, right now, able at level 60 to practically instantly buy themselves to victory in Act 1 Inferno, and very soon they’ll be doing the same for Act 2. And it won’t stop; the “playable area” of the Diablo 3 end game will just continue to shrink.

Solutions

There are a bunch of solutions and a lot of room for discussion, but here's what I consider to be the best one:

Refocus the game back to the individual's own personal progression, and give good benefits for playing with friends. 

Get rid of both Auction Houses, regardless of whatever PR shaming that might involve. 

Revive the concept of Bind-on-Pickup that's become basically universal in the 12 years since Diablo 2. Make every bound item basically be Bind-on-Account, usable by every character on your account. Also make every item that drops in the game be tradeable to any other player in that game within an hour after the drop occurred. So, you've got some incentive to play in a multiplayer game with other classes, since items that aren't auctionable anyway might as well be tradeable to other members of your party.

Retain gold and gems as tradeable items, still useful for repairs and crafting. Crafting materials, however, should largely be the limiting factor in the actual crafting of items, and those would also be soulbound to give some incentive to keep running dungeons and grabbing items. The "consolation prize", as it were, for item drops that aren't directly useful. In fact, it seemed like this was their original purpose in the game, which just happened to be completely negated by the allure of the Auction House. 

Some people believe that "trading" is one of the core aspects of the Diablo series, but I disagree. I feel that it was largely primitive and inconvenient in those games, which were perfectly playable without it and even enhanced like that. So bring back that feel of searching for *your own* loot upgrades, not for gold, and create a game that you're encouraged to play for your own progression.

I think you're calling the shots a little soon, since the RMAH has yet to launch and the economy is still a mess because of artisan costs, inferno drop rates , and exploits.

Well I do agree with the general idea of the spirit of your post, using a virtually limitless commodity as the center of buying power is going to completely skew the entire economy as a whole. I made my own forum about this earlier, gold has got to go.

But I do disagree with you're assessment of how its only going to get worse. As long as all items in the game can drop at any part of inferno, every player in inferno has an opportunity to farm such items. Right now its been so completely screwy because a group of players has had a complete monopoly on the supply. And the demand is huge because no one else can farm these items.

However, I do think eventually players will stop using gold as the many currency besides money.

This is exactly how things will turn out.
You described very well what the current situation is, what will most likely come and why it will come.

The farmers control the game right now already through their ~100 bots each farmer got making billions of gold each day.
What do you think how many gold will flood the RMAH once it starts out? Trillions? More?
An unbelievable inflation of not only gold but items as well.
Everything the "casual", "average" or even "experienced" player farms will become completely worthless. 

You got a few millions of money right now? Once the RMAH is up, your millions will be worth on the market what right now a few thousands of gold are worth.
But no problem, every item that is worth millions right now will be nothing worth as well once the RMAH goes live. You'll get top equip easily for few money. But that's where the game ends for most. 
Have fun farming items that are nothing worth because that and the achievements are everything that's left then.

For one, as the high-end gamers start to crunch into Act 3 and 4, there’s going to be a trickle of high-level items into the AH that eventually becomes a flood.

Even now, barely four weeks into the game, high-end item costs far exceed what the average player can actually grind out.

This is the best part of this excellently argued post. Right now there is both severe gold inflation and "item decompression" going on. The middle tier of items usefulness has already been completely destroyed: just 4 weeks into the release of this game, there is ALMOST ZERO incentive for a player to pick up any weapon, rare or not, in Hell and Act 1 Inferno because there is no value to it. Inexplicably, moving past the content requires items that don't drop in the difficulty you are currently at, forcing use of the AH; and using the AH one rapidly finds a glut of "discards" that are growing rapidly in supply, driving down prices. Unlike in real life economics, second best items have zero value to their finder. I was just searching this morning and realized that 1200+ DPS magic 2-handers have become the new "base" item, utterly trivializing the later Acts of Hell and Act I inferno. 

All that will matter in a few weeks will be perfectly rolled, "end-game" items that will not be available on the GAH, only able to purchased on the RMAH, as people fight to escape Acts 1 & 2 Inferno to farm Act 3. Even these "uber" items will be subject to rapid price decompression as more people progress with their newly bought upgrades, leaving zero incentive for people to continue to farm for the mains because possible upgrades from those end-game weapons will be utterly trivial to the point of killing speed, combined with the silly decision of Blizzard to allow re-specing, which though superficially limiting, gave characters an identity and increased the worth of "second-best" items. 

Blizzard unleashed the dragon when they thought up Auction House functionality. I image they thought it would just be a profitable side-project: Instead, it changes fundamentally in every way character progression and the way people are playing the game.

I have to disagree. I think these fundamental problems can be anticipated well before we have to observe the real world results to confirm them.

these people have dealt with gold farmers for YEARS, and yet they didnt think this was going to happen? the second i heard the first details about the RMAH i thought to myself " wow , a chinese farmers wet dream" , but i wasnt expecting loot and itemization to be made to funnel me towards it...


It definitely seems as though they were focusing Diablo 3 kinda towards the "quick, fun diversion" end of the scale relative to WoW, but it had a lot of potential to be replayable for a long time. But frankly, the way things are going right now, I don't think anybody will find the "end game" interesting enough to bother when they feel it's just about grinding out gold or busting out cash.

After Act 4, Normal... Game Over.

About 7 hours of derivative linear story with a rather anti-climatic end.
All yours for a mere $60.

I can't really disagree with the OP, but... no one's forcing you to use the AH.

I haven't bought a single thing and I'm enjoying myself quite a bit. The people who want to buy their way to Inferno... well, have fun. I'm just not interested.

While I understand where you're coming from, let's look at it this way. The people the AH effects are not you or I. We're the majority. The people who play to enjoy the game and don't necessarily need to be the best. The AH is geared at players who have to be the best. The competitive edge provided by this feature is simply astounding. Therein lies the problem. We can compare this to any MMORPG based on this theory. 

The GAH/RMAH are akin to the Dungeon Journal in WoW. Why would anybody serious about progression not use a feature that ultimately makes progression easier? Sure, you can choose not to use it. That's not wrong. You are entitled to your ideals and opinions. The AH is targeted at a very specific audience within the game. The problem here, though, is that the problem will trickle into the majority of the community. This is for one simple reason: convenience. A system of essentially buying power for money (The F2P model rings a few bells) will draw in you or I. Under this system we don't have to be the best. We just have to have the most.

Disclaimer: I'm not saying the RMAH is a free to play scheme. I'm simply stating what it is. It WILL be used, and it IS here to stay. It WILL have a huge impact on the game as a whole. There's no way to stop it. If how terrible the GAH economy is right now is not indication enough, then I don't know what else to say.

I think this post is pretty spot on, but I believe that part of the issue that this came to be is cause of some game mechanics. Where as Range had a pretty big advantage in progression while melee had to rely on a ton of gear. While all classes need gear, melee required more sooner then range, halting their progression, fueling the need to go to the AH to aquire gear to proceed.

The biggest piece of advice I would consistantly hear (since I play monk) was to get better gear from the AH, because you were very very unlikely going to find the progression gear for later acts in Act I and II.

Range faired better and could just stack dps and with skill move through act III and IV, get those higher items, sell them down the chain or keep them to themselves and make it to farm status.

Now thats over simplification, but it has added to the issue you proposed. A lot of inferno content by those in inferno mode would not have been cleared without access to the AH. While this is just a personal example, I did not even hit the AH until Inferno mode, after having a bit of difficulty.

Edit: As for hte free to play ordeal, previously mentioned, the RMAH is not an F2P thing. F2P transactions allow the player to get commodities in the game taht will not affect gameplay between players or the game itself. Thats like having special pets taht are fun, special armor, or services such as Char Transfers. The RMAH is actually in that sense MUCH MUCH WORSE. The RMAH directly affects gameplay between players and the game, as items are being sold for real cash, to ease progression/save time. In this sense, the best players in the game are going to invariably be those with teh most money in their pockets. In the end, it wont matter how skilled you are, you will not likely be able to farm enough G to get the competative gaer gold wise, and if your pockets arent relatively deep, you wont be able to afford it. If this were competative play, RMAH users will always be top. In all likely hood, the RMAH was probably ready to go on release, but was stalled simply because it would inversly affect game progression and world first acheives.

Diablo 3 has been out for almost a month now. A good number of launch day players have one or several level 60 characters, and they’re working on and learning about Hell and Inferno. They’re experiencing the entirety of what this incredibly-anticipated title has to offer. 

And many of them are coming up disappointed.
