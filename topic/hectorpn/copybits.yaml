The 6th Vessel is that christogenetical containment of a human splicing of crucifixion radiancy of a brain villi of mode of halogrammatry and this now 6th Vessel of human crucifix-minded containment is filled of halotetragrammic connectivity of creationism and humanism wherein the dropping of vessels is a fountain of lights and that structural crucifixion ... e.g., the 6th vessel of human fulfillment in parametry is a mirroring of thou tetragrammatonic mind of the nature of creation in its marriages basically on our earthly creation in a helical covenant as it is also tetragrammatonically thouself in recreating fulfillment ... and in that human mind of pentagrammic stance of a sundial circle is an area of creation in fluidity designings like an altar of lights and from transferences upon many a dark age there was light in the dark bioluminescence on many a pyramidal heights where human hands of directionality beheld the lights ... ergo, it was always the architectural containment of where creationism beheld a spiritism born of a womb of humanity was a that strangest development of cathedralism ... it is that equationist gearing as it seemingly is a circumcision of light and flesh in a womb called cathedralism
